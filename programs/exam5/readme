This program must solve a standard 9x9 sudoku puzzle. The program must display the unsolved puzzle first, then compute, and then display the unsolved and solved puzzle at the
same time. Every row, column, and 3x3 region contains each digit 1-9 exactly once.


Requirements:
    solve the provided puzzle
    use c++


Note:
    Program is not required to accept or process any additional user input, I am adding the functionality to accept input but the default option will be hardcoded in as as well. 



Basic Steps:
    1. Accept input of puzzle
    2. Display unsolved puzzle
    3. Solve puzzle
    4. Display solved puzzle 



Current Progress:
    program seems to work? hardcoded option seems to be correct, will physically do as a check as well. Will be trying to find faster possible options to optimize.
